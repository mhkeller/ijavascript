# IJavascript: A Javascript Kernel for IPython's Graphical Notebook

IJavascript is an [`npm` package](https://www.npmjs.com/) that implements a
Javascript kernel for [IPython's graphical
notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) (also known as
[Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/)). An IPython notebook combines the creation of
rich-text documents (including equations, plots and videos) with the execution
of code in a number of programming languages.

The execution of code is carried out by means of a kernel that implements the
[IPython messaging
protocol](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/development/messaging.html).
There are kernels available for [Python](http://ipython.org/notebook.html),
[Julia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl),
[Ruby](https://github.com/minad/iruby),
[Haskell](https://github.com/gibiansky/IHaskell) and [many
other languages](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/IPython-kernels-for-other-languages).

## Main Features

- Run Javascript code within a `node.js` session
- [Autocompletion](doc/tutorials/complete.md): press `TAB` to complete keywords and object
  properties
- [Object inspection](doc/tutorials/inspect.md): press `Shift-TAB` to inspect an object
  and show its content or, if available, its documentation
- [Graphical output](doc/ipynb/graphics.ipynb) for `HTML`, `PNG`, ...

## Installation

The instructions to install IJavascript are platform-dependent. For example, in
Ubuntu 14.04, IJavascript and its prerequisites can be installed simply by
running:

```sh
sudo apt-get install nodejs-legacy npm ipython ipython-notebook libzmq-dev
sudo npm install -g ijavascript
```

For other platforms, please, refer to the [installation notes](doc/tutorials/install.md).

## Usage

To start an IPython notebook session with the IJavascript kernel, run:

```sh
ijs
```

This command should open the IPython notebook dashboard in your default web
browser:

Here's a sample notebook that makes use of the IJavascript kernel:

Please, refer to the [usage notes](doc/tutorials/usage.md) for further details.

## Documentation

You can build the documentation for this package with the command `make jsdoc`.
To run this command you'll need to install ipython on your system as it uses
nb convert to convert ipython notebooks to html files.
